# repl-rs
Rust repl

## News
Currently all effort are directed to the new repl [IRust](https://github.com/sigmaSd/IRust)

The major advantage is cross platform support

## Keywords / Tips & Tricks
**reset** => reset repl

**show** => show repl current code

**add** *<dep_list>* => add dependencies (requires [cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit))

You can use arrow keys to cycle through commands history

## Keybindings

**Ctrl-l** to clear repl

**Ctrl-c** to exit

**Page-Up** to scroll up

**Page-Down** to scroll down

## Showcase

## Current Plans

**1-** Syntax highlight

**2-** Autocompletion

***NB:*** Would be cool to check out and maybe integrate **rls**

## Current Limitations

**1-** Does't support Windows, can happen if someone helps out with windows support on [tuikit](https://github.com/lotabout/tuikit)
